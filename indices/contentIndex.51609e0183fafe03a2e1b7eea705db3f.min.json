simple at first glance but very powerful when applied. At its core, it's just a four folder wide hierarchy with four-layer deeps, starting with those four root folders:\n\n1.  Projects\n2.  Areas\n3.  Resources\n4.  Archive\n\nFrom there, each of the roots is allowed one sub-folder level and then notes. That's how the four levels deep work: App (1) -\u003e `1. Projects` (2) -\u003e P.A.R.A. Demo Vault (3) -\u003e Methodology (4). The reason for this is to keep it manageable and easy to remember and navigate. That restriction was initially because of Evernote limitation, but it turns out to have some serendipity potential. By putting all your notes from similar \"zone\" and actionability together, you end up with many serendipitous findings of new related notes and ideas.\n\nJust those root folders and their children, the system can contain everything most people needs for their notes and files. This taxonomy works because you don't split things based on categories but actionability and areas of your life. So now, let's define those roots to help see how it works.\n\n## Definition\n1.  Projects: *Every current project that is actionable with its notes, files, artifacts*\n\t- If you have a project that requires notes or files, it should have a folder in 1. Projects.\n\t- Since this folder is for projects you are working on _right now_, it's the most actionable and probably where you will spend most of your time.\n2. Areas: *Zone of responsibility with standard to uphold over long periods*, parent, animals, management, coding, house.\n\t- Areas are **the personal** bucket of your life for important things that don't have an end date. You won't ever \"stop\" working on your health; for example, it's a constant ongoing thing.\n\t- While areas can (and often do) generate projects, they are not linked since it's already intuitive which areas a project comes from, so there's no need to create an explicit link between, for example, the \"Server maintenance\" project and the \"Sysadmin\" area.\n\t- Finally, because they are personal, areas contain information you wrote for _yourself only_ about those areas in your life. Which is opposite to 3. Resources.\n3. Resources: *Zone of interest for various topics that don't require standard/responsibility*, game, cooking, productivity, technology.\n\t- Resources are **generally helpful for others**, not just you. For example, if someone was to ask you for information about cooking, you could zip that folder and send it to them.\n\t- The folders in there will very often reflect your various interests, what you're curious about and want to learn more about.\n\t- They are not necessarily actual \"resources\" as in PDF, Pictures, etc. they can also be notes about those subjects\n4. Archives: *Where stuff from all the other category become unused*, finished project, change of responsibility, etc.\n\t- This folder will be where you put things you won't need for a while, as the name suggests. For the most part, something in there won't be seen for a time, and that's why it has the lowest actionability, but sometimes a new project could use things in there, or a change of areas might mean you need to get stuff out of there.\n\t- For example, you have lots of notes on living with a pet in a small apartment, and then you move to a new bigger one. You could move all those to the archive if one day you have to go back to a small apartment again take them out.\n\n## Setup\nThe setup for it is pretty simple, create root folders for each category, like in this sandbox. From there, move all of your current notes into `4. Archives` as is with the same existing hierarchy (remember it's not deleted üòâ). Then create one folder for each of your current projects you're working on in `1. Projects` (remember only one sub-folder to stay four levels deep). For `2. Areas`, if you already know some of them, you can create the folders already, but try not to have too many empty folders. Finally, `3. Resources`, you want to stay empty for now unless you already captured things that could go in it. The idea is that each time you go into `4. Archives` to take one of the \"old\" notes or files, you then move it to the right spot in the new taxonomy. Doing it this way will highlight the most used notes, and what's left behind can stay in Archive until it's finally used (or not).\n\nOnce you have the folder hierarchy done, you want to copy it across all your other systems; that is where P.A.R.A. starts to shine. You want to have the same hierarchy for your local files on your computer, in your notes, in your Dropbox/Google Drive/iCloud, and everywhere else you have to keep information. Doing that will make it very quick and easy to find things you might need for work or something in the same zone across all your apps. For this reason, the more system you integrate the taxonomy into, the easier finding things will be.\n\n### Setup tips:\n- If a note (or a file) can go into two different folders, you put it in the folder where you will **_most likely need it next_** since folders are based on actionability, and it will get moved anyway in the flow of things.\n- You can also have the \"same\" folder in 2 different roots. For example, `2. Areas/Health` and `3. Resources/Health` the first one is **_your_** health notes and the other **general** health-related notes.\n- Remember, you do **_not_** want to sort all your current notes and files and put them in the new folder, put them all in the Archive as is, and then move them out as you use them.\n- You do **_not_** have to do every single folder for your local files and cloud service; create the sub-folders are you need them, **_but_** you need to have one complete setup, most likely in your notes, to act as the primary reference for the others.\n\n\n# Next stop [[1.

Most of the flowing and moving in the system will happen when you use the notes or when you are done with a project; that's why starting and finishing projects are crucial moments. As notes can flow to/from each part of the P.A.R.A, it's best to show with examples:\n\n## Example 1 - Project\nThis example is the \"normal\" workflow for most things. First, you start with a project, something like writing this starter kit.\n\nYou first create the folder for the project once you're ready. Then you go around `2. Areas` and `3. Resources` to find the information possibly useful for the project; in this case, I would look in my `Second Brain` folder and my `Personal Knowledge Management` folder. From there starts the first flow, you take those notes, pictures, etc., and put them in the folder. At this point, you use them to create the product and complete the project.\n\nOnce the project is over, the 2nd flow can start; it's time to look at all the notes and artifacts you created and used. For each of them, see if they would still be helpful later if they could be turned into a template or formatted more generically. The idea is to keep those around for use in other projects later, so put them in the correct `2. Areas` folder. The remainder goes into `4. Archives`.\n\n## Example 2 - Areas change\nYou decided to change your job and launch your own business in a completely different field. That would mean most of the information in your job-related `2. Areas` would not be actionable anymore. So now you can look if some things in that area could still be helpful and move the rest to `4. Archives`.\n\nIf a couple of months later something comes up and it forces you to get back into that first field, take the folder out of `4. Archives` and put it back into `2. Areas`, and you're back into business just like before.\n\n## Example 3 - Resource change\nSince things in `3. Resources` interest you to learn more about it can be that it changes at some point. A resource folder on `Marketing`, for example, could turn into a freelance job in marketing.\n\nWhen that happens, you now have a standard to uphold (freelance standard), so you create a new folder in `2. Areas` for \"Marketing\" and move all the notes you wrote yourself from `3. Resources` into that new one (since `2. Areas` is for things you wrote yourself)\n\n\n# Next step Explore!\nYou're officially done with the explanation now; you can proceed to try it for yourself or explore more around. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask on the forum thread or read the [P.A.R.A. complete article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for a deeper dive into all the details.\n\nIf you want to look at more demo vaults like this, I also have my own system, a fork of P.A.R.A. for my use over [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/paan-starter-kit/21782). Finally, for more general writing, I have my blog where I will often write about that system or others at [maximecote.me](https://maximecote.me/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/2.-Areas/":{"title":"2-Areas","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/2.-Areas/Blog/Blog":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"2.

I had a lot of projects going on, but nothing out of the ordinary. I had 3-4 projects I was tracking. I was looking at my schedule weekly. Everything should be fine normally. But then I started to feel the pull of trying new application. That's not nescessarily a good default really to go chase the \"oh shiny\" but if I let myself experiement, fully knowing about it, I often end up finding the actual pain point to fix. So I tried a bunch of new apps and ways to try to fix the problem I was having.

This is why the words of dead poets, politicians, and philosophers grow increasingly influential as time runs its course\n\n---\n\nIn this case, the always-on nature of the mind is a key feature of our species, creating products that hopefully increase well-being with each release.\n\n---\n\nIf Condition #1 is taken to its logical endpoint, then we will view the natural world primarily for its utility, rather than for its sheer beauty\n\n---\n\nIf Condition #2 is taken to its logical endpoint, then things look even bleaker. If everything we touch in the material world has to serve some sort of function, isn't it only a matter of time before humans themselves have to serve some sort of greater function as well\n\n---\n\nIn both scenarios, however, labor and leisure were delineated by physical space. If you were situated within the four walls of your factory or office, it was time to work. If you found yourself within the four walls of your home, it was time to relax\n\n---\n\nThe home is no longer an environmental cue to put work aside. It is a place that constantly reminds you that there is always more work to be done.\n\n---\n\nAvailability is no longer determined by one's time, but by one's attention.\n\n---\n\nTechnological progress in the era of knowledge work can be defined by these three things:\n\n(1) Make it easier to connect with others,\n\n(2) Make it faster to get what you need,\n\n(3) Make it pretty and appealing.\n\n---\n\nWe willingly tether ourselves to the constant demands of the workplace, either by actively working on our projects during the day, or by passively checking on their progress at night.\n\n---\n\nbut given this dynamic, it seems inevitable that we start defining ourselves by what we're able to produce, while everything else goes by the wayside.\n\n---\n\nWork, like everything else in nature, follows a circadian rhythm. Intense periods of energy expenditure are followed by requisite periods of rest. The important thing is that the rest must be sustained, and not broken up by intermittent worries and thoughts. That's like getting 8 hours of sleep, but having it interrupted by the hour. You and I know that nothing productive will be done the following morning.\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/2.-Areas/Job/block-sudo-to-specific-command":{"title":"","content":"If your user is called `user` and your host is called you could add these lines to `/etc/sudoers`:\n\n```\nuser = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\nuser = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot\n```\n\nThis will allow the user `user` to run the desired commands without entering a password. All other sudoed commands will still require a password.\n\nThe commands specified in the `sudoers` file _must_ be fully qualified (i.e. using the absolute path to the command to run)\n\nIf the command ends with a trailing `/` character and points to a directory, the user will be able to run any command in that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein). In the following example, the user `user` can run any command in the directory `/home/someuser/bin/`:\n\n```\nuser = (root) NOPASSWD: /home/someuser/bin/\n```\n\nAs an alternative to editing the `/etc/sudoers` file, you could add the two lines to a new file in `/etc/sudoers.d` e.g. `/etc/sudoers.d/shutdown`. This is an elegant way of separating different changes to the `sudo` rights and also leaves the original `sudoers` file untouched for easier upgrades.\n\n*visudo can be used to edit those files too, this prevent error that could lock you out of the system*\n```\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown \n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/2.-Areas/Job/curl-POST-examples":{"title":"","content":"\n\n## Common Options\n- `#`, `--progress-bar` Make curl display a simple progress bar instead of the more informational standard meter.\n- `b`, --cookie \u003cname=data\u003e Supply cookie with request.

In other words: what do people get together to do?¬†  In her experience, Bailey has found that people tend to get together in order to do something that is better in a group, like teach each other, support each other, and meet up locally\n\nYour shared activity should have the following traits: \n- Purposeful: It brings your community‚Äôs ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to life \n- Participatory: It gives others the chance to contribute (ideally, you shouldn‚Äôt do all the work!)  \n- Repeatable: It takes place regularly, which builds a habit or ritual (Bailey noted that organizing a community is like running a cafe: you need to keep the doors open for your patrons.)\n\nYour writing is a beacon for like-minded readers, even if you don‚Äôt know who they all are yet! Giving your readers the chance to get to know you, as well as their fellow subscribers, can be a powerful experience. Once you know who your audience is, the what‚Äôs and how‚Äôs of building your community will easily follow.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Cooking/":{"title":"Cooking","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Cooking/7-Low-Sodium-Lunches-Under-400-Calories":{"title":"","content":"**1.

That variable is a module, whose attributes are the global variables created in the module's file\n\nWhether you find it aesthetically ugly, or annoying to type, or confusing, or if you just want to put it in the current namespace, you can do that with:\n    from foobar import hello\n\nOr if you want both of them, you can say\n    from foobar import hello, x\n\nOnce you have done this, the names \"hello\" and \"x\" are defined in your current namespace, and you can use them to access the module's attributes\n\nNote that I keep saying, \"the current namespace.\" That's because \"import\", like \"def\", is a way to define a variable. When you use \"def\", you're both creating a function object and setting a variable (the function name) to point to that function object. And when you use \"import\", you're both creating a module object, and setting a variable (the module name) to point to that module object.\n\nBut all variables can be global or local -- and modules are no different.\n\nI should note that while you can use an \"import\" statement anywhere, it's pretty rare in my experience to have it anywhere but at the global scope\n\nSo: \"from-import\" loads the entire module, and puts the module in sys.modules. It then creates aliases to the specified names in the local namespace.\n\nAnd if you're using \"from-import\" because you want to save memory, or don't want to load an entire module, that's obviously bad news.\n\nWhen you say \"from import *\", you're saying that it would be totally OK for the module's variables to overwrite the variables that you have defined in the current namespace\n\nFor starters, \"from-import\" ignores names that start with an underscore (_) character\n\nIf I want, I can also define the variable __all__, a list of strings indicating which names should be exported when you use a wildcard","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Development/Development":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"3.

People Are Expensive.\"\nAuthor: \nFrom: \n\n## Highlights:\n\nMy point is that it took a long time for people to realize that it was OK to work with a high-level language, and that doing so didn't make you a worse programmer. When you use a high-level language, your programs might run a bit more slowly, but that's often an acceptable compromise.\n\n---\n\n**==In today's world, computers are cheap, while people are expensive.==**\n\n---\n\nLet's assume that a Python program runs twice as slowly as the equivalent Java program, and thus requires two servers instead of one server. In today's world, that server difference will probably cost a few hundred dollars per month.  If the programmer writing the software is 5x as productive, then that server is more than paid for by the increase in efficiency.\n\n---\n\nThis doesn't mean, of course, that you don't need to worry about slow code, or that there's no need for C++ programmers in the world any more. But the need for speed is increasingly balanced by something even more important: The need for maintainable software.\n\n---\n\nOne of the reasons I love Python is that the code is clear and readable, allowing me to join a new project and dive in, because the code is written similarly to all of the other Python code I've read and written over the years.\n\n---\n\nBetter to save your colleagues (and company) money by making things more efficient for people, rather than for computers.\n\n---\n\nYour 1st comment on this article **Note:** Really interesting insight with the switch to a high level language to save people time and make debugging easier instead of saving server resources. It might not always be the right equation like in our case where the biggest expense are the servers but in many cases it would be true that human price \u003e server price\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Drawing/":{"title":"Drawing","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Drawing/Drawing":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"3.

The same study states that 73% say they are willing to pay more for a product if they love the brand. These statistics call attention to the fact that customer experience is critical.\n\nre-imagine every touchpoint a consumer has with their brand, delivering an experience-based, emotional connection. These organizations are looking past traditional ways to attract and retain customers and designing compelling, personalized experiences ‚Äì via advanced technologies ‚Äì around products and services to better engage.\n\nThe term ‚ÄúExperience Economy‚Äù was coined a few decades ago by James H. Gilmore and B. Joseph Pine II. The two, who co-authored a book of the same name, describe that consumers seek experiences above and beyond products and services. In the book, they explain that services must be mass-customized for each individual need and that offerings must be charged for time (i.e., subscriptions). They also urge more organizations to pay attention not just to what workers should do, but how they do it.\n\nThe customer experience is not merely about your mobile app, your website or your call center agents ‚Äì it runs deep inside the four walls of your company. All of the internal processes, people and systems that contribute to your brand‚Äôs overall customer experience ‚Äì those operations that take place behind the scenes ‚Äì are just as much a part of that customer experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, brand interactions must be easy for consumers. They must co-exist in the natural rhythm of consumers‚Äô daily lives.\n\nFrom a consumer‚Äôs perspective, what matters most is that their brand interaction simply works and provides value\n\nPart of this strategy involves leveraging technology and data to decode the nuances of consumer behaviors and sensibilities that drive their unique brand interactions and decision-making processes\n\nDon‚Äôt generalize your customers and prospects.\n\nThese lenses are too narrowly focused and don‚Äôt expose the more valuable behavioral criteria that inspire long-term, emotional connections. Intead, utilize technology to develop a more robust, data-driven picture of your audience.\n\nconsumers ourselves, perhaps many of us are used to accessing anything we want, at any given time, through all of our connected networks. Similarly, customers expect their brand experiences to be on the ready, whether it‚Äôs via a smartphone, tablet or any other device\n\nno longer to dictate an exchange but to facilitate one.\n\nDevelop a strategy that accounts for business needs, market demands and technology\n\nthe Experience Economy must be backed by your data\n\nUtilize your back-office to generate the right amount of data about individual consumers.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.064497102Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Marketing/Marketing":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"3.

These imagined readers force me to ask myself honestly if I understand what I am writing.\n\nThe end result is that writing forces me to acknowledge and then work through my confusion.\n\nSummarizing a paper in your own words restructures the content to focus on learning rather than novelty.\n\nA side effect of having written detailed technical notes is that I\ncalibrate my confidence on a topic. If I now understand something, I am sure of it and can explain myself clearly. If I don't understand something, I have a sense of why it is difficult to understand or what prerequisite knowledge I am missing.\n\nFor me, writing things down is the best way I have found to ensure that I actually do the work.\n\nBlogging has taught me how to read a paper because explaining something is a more active form of understanding\n\nThis process mimics the act of presenting and is great practice for it.\n\nHowever, with proficiency came creativity. Programming became less important than what I was building and why. When I started my PhD, I hypothesized that the same rules would apply: I wouldn't be able to think creatively about machine learning until I built up the requisite knowledge base. In programming, you can practice by writing programs; but how can you practice research? For me, writing detailed, expository technical notes is the equivalent of the programmer's side project: it forces me to intentionally and systematically build my knowledge base by understanding ideas, working through proofs, and implementing models.\n\nMy understanding and confidence in the material changed profoundly. I became intellectually committed in a way that was impossible without first understanding the problem\n\nUnder pressure, my mind, like a cart on a well-worn path, finds the same old ruts. Once again, writing breaks this cycle because it requires more active participation.\n\nHard problems are intimidating; and I often do not know where to start and am worried that I will waste my time. Writing blog posts about the larger context of a problem is my way of flanking it, of head faking myself about what I am actually doing. This lowers the psychological stakes because, rather than directly attacking the problem, I am producing something that I know will be valuable either way.\n\nThese posts, written in the spring and summer, allowed me to start thinking about and preparing for the problem indirectly.\n\nHowever, writing is my other way of mitigating risk. If my current\nproject were to fail, the directed and intentional process of\nsystematically attacking the background material will have prepared me well for the next problem.\n\nIf you don't see that what you are working on is almost obvious, then you are not ready to work on that yet.\n\nI find this quote comforting because it suggests that good ideas---at least for one famous mathematician---do not come into the mind ex niliho. Rather, good ideas come from so deeply understanding a problem that the solution seems obvious.\n\nIn my own experience, writing has gotten me closer than anything else to having original research thoughts that feel obvious.\n\nBy understanding problems deeply, you increase the probability that you can work on an important, attackable problem.\n\nI think of writing-as-learning as database indexing. In a database, an index is a data structure that efficiently keeps track of where rows in a table are located. To insert into a database via an index is slower than simply adding the row to the bottom of the table because the database must do some bookkeeping. However, querying a database is extremely efficient. A layperson's example is organizing your books alphabetically.\n\nImportantly, I had forgotten if the relationship were true, but it felt correct, and I knew exactly where to look to confirm my guess.\n\nMaybe one thing I appreciate more now is that the state of human knowledge is full of holes. When you're young you have the impression that almost everything is known, but now I have this feeling that almost everything is unknown about mathematics. There are these very thin channels that people have gone along, like ants following each other along a trail. You find these long thin trails of things, and most things are undeveloped. I have more of a sense of the openness of it.\n\nIn short, mathematics only exists in a living community of\nmathematicians that spreads understanding and breaths life into ideas both old and new. The real satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from others and sharing with others. All of us have clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many more. There is no way to run out of ideas in need of clarification. The question of who is the first person to ever set foot on some square meter of land is really secondary. Revolutionary change does matter, but revolutions are few,\nand they are not self-sustaining --- they depend very heavily on the community of mathematicians.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Productivity/":{"title":"Productivity","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Productivity/Busy-is-a-choice-productive-is-a-skill":{"title":"","content":"https://seths.blog/2019/11/busy-is-a-choice-productive-is-a-skill/\n\nProductivity, on the other hand, has little to do with busy. \nProductivity requires bringing soft skills (real skills) to the table in service of the generous work you seek to do. \nProductivity is learned.

Admin blocks are 30‚Äì60 minute lower-energy blocks of time where you‚Äôre not in the zone to do the work that requires heavy lifting, but there are still other types of work you can do effectively. Social blocks are 90‚Äì120 minute blocks of time where you‚Äôre primed and energetically in the right space to meet with other people. Recovery blocks are variable-length blocks of time that you use for exercise, meditation, and self-care.\n\nmost people have a hard time creating and using more than three per day because of distractions, interruptions, daily routines, and a lack of intention\n\nFocus blocks fuel your highest-value deep work. No focus blocks, no finished deep work. It‚Äôs really that simple\n\nrather than thinking in terms of hours required to get something done, you can just count the focus blocks you have available. Anything over ten hours starts to become hard for us to deal with because it gets amorphous and hard to visualize, but five blocks is easier to understand because we can think about the chunks of the projects we can do in that amount of time.\n\nit‚Äôs the same amount of energy in a different configuration, but the configuration makes all the difference\n\nYou may also need to use focus blocks for projects and work that look like admin but actually require a good bit of strategizing, thinking, problem-solving, or wordsmithing to get right\n\nPushing too many focus blocks leads to creative burnout. It‚Äôs quite common for people to have a four- or five-block day, only to drag for the next few days and wonder what‚Äôs wrong.\n\nConsistent progress is better than fits and starts.\n\nThe number of focus blocks you have available is the limiting factor to how quickly and steadily you‚Äôll be able to make progress on your high-value creative projects\n\nanything that supports the deep work but isn‚Äôt the deep work itself\n\nAdmin blocks give you time to reflect upon your work, and they create space and context for things to gel. Knowing that there will be admin blocks allows you to stress less about all the admin work that does need to be attended to. There‚Äôs a time and a space for everything. Well-positioned admin blocks make it easier to catch the frogs because that task is confined to smaller periods of the day.\n\nFocus blocks are focused on creating something, whereas social blocks are focused on connecting with someone.\n\nProductivity is about more than getting stuff done ‚Äî it‚Äôs about using your resources in ways that bring about the most value in your life.\n\nI usually will speak of social blocks as social/service blocks to remind people that real-time service hours are social blocks.\n\n\nthey make for great bookends to other blocks because most of us honor commitments to other people more than we honor commitments to ourselves\n\nFocus, admin, and social blocks are energy output blocks,\n\nwe actually need to be more intentional about them than about any of the other blocks precisely because we‚Äôre over-focused on output.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more important than the type of activity is what the activity does for you. A major upshot to acknowledging and using recovery blocks is that it allows you to find dead zones in your day that can be repurposed for recovery\n\nAs a general rule, plan on a recovery block for every two focus or social blocks.\n\nrecovery blocks can also be a good follow-on to a focus block since focus blocks are often the most taxing of the blocks.\n\nDon‚Äôt go longer than two Focus and/or Social blocks back to back without a Recovery block. You need to recharge, and the work and the people you‚Äôre meeting with will benefit more. Put your Focus blocks where you have the best creative energy. If you‚Äôve filled out the Productivity Heatmap, red and orange times are where your Focus Blocks should go. Put your Social blocks where you‚Äôre most fit for human consumption. Note that you can be red/orange in the morning for solo work but not for meeting with folks. Avoid putting an Admin Block first thing in the morning, but if you must, be intentional about processing it, looking only for items that are relevant for the day. Recovery Blocks are the wildcard ‚Äî I highly suggest a morning routine that includes some combination of movement, eating, meditation/prayer, and planning/intention-setting. Night owls still benefit by starting with self-care. As best you can, be consistent with the times you‚Äôre putting your blocks in. For instance, if your best creative time is from 9 a.m.‚Äì12 p.m., try to have two creative blocks per morning every workday. If you‚Äôre most fit for human consumption in the afternoon, try to schedule your meetings for the afternoon. This will help you get into good grooves, improve your habit-building, and give you some powerful defaults that limit decision-fatigue. Chores and commutes are closest to Admin blocks, so you can give them time as such. That said, feel free to create Commute or Chores blocks if that makes the most sense for you.\n\nIn general, people struggle the most with finding/creating Focus blocks, with the real root cause being that it‚Äôs harder to claim time for ourselves than to give it to others.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Productivity/Productivity":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"3.

There‚Äôs no ambiguity or vagueness in how and when your goal will happen==\n- ==Measurable: You have a meaningful and motivating way to track progress and measure your results. You‚Äôll know if you‚Äôve hit your goal 80%, 100% or missed the mark entirely.==\n- ==Achievable: You‚Äôre not shooting for the moon (unless you think you can realistically hit i==\n- ==Relevant: You‚Äôre working towards something that is worthwhile, timely, and deeply connected to your own skills and long-term goals. You‚Äôll be motivated to work towards this goal.==\n- ==Time-bound: There are clear start and end dates you‚Äôre working towards. (It‚Äôs important to note that SMART goals are most useful for more short-term goals‚Äîone month to one year).==\n\nOn the surface, SMART goals are great at ensuring you don‚Äôt fall into bad goal-setting red flags. For example:  Hastily choosing a number or metric to go after without thinking it through. For example, saying you want to increase sales by 40% without having a reason why that‚Äôs the metric and goal to go after. Glossing over how other teams will be involved. For example, saying that you‚Äôll build a new feature without involving your product team. Missing a crucial step along the way. For example, agreeing on a clear first step and final result but not knowing how you‚Äôre going to get from A to B.\n\n1. Replace ‚Äúshould‚Äù with ‚Äúwill‚Äù In her book The Crossroads of Should and Must, artist Elle Luna describes the word should as a non-commitment. ‚ÄúShould‚Äù is a non-starter for your goals. Instead, be specific and use action words like ‚Äúwill‚Äù.  For example, ‚ÄúBy the end of the week, I should will finish and send the final website design to my client.‚Äù \n\n2. Change ‚Äúsoon‚Äù to a specific timeline Despite time-bound being a large part of the SMART goal system, many people are afraid to commit to an actual specific date. But your goals lose power if they don‚Äôt have an end date.  For example, ‚ÄúI will send 10 cold emails to prospective clients soon by 4pm on Wednesday.‚Äù\n\n3. Switch ‚Äúneed to‚Äù to ‚Äúwant to‚Äù Saying you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to do something frames your goal in a negative way. Instead, saying you ‚Äúwant‚Äù to do it is a much more positive way to stay motivated. (This is mostly when talking about personal goals. In the workplace, there are many situations where you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to do something).  For example, ‚ÄúI need to want to wake up at 6:30 am each morning so that I can go to the gym before work.‚Äù \n\n4. Replace ‚Äúquit‚Äù with ‚Äústop‚Äù While your goal might be to change a behavior, saying you want to ‚Äúquit‚Äù has all sorts of negative connotations that can get in your way. No one wants to feel like a quitter (even if they want to quit something). Instead, say you‚Äôll ‚Äústop‚Äù doing it.  For example, ‚ÄúFor the next 3 weeks, I will quit stop eating lunch at my desk and take a proper break.‚Äù\n\n5. Change ‚ÄúNever‚Äù to a specific action Few things turn us off from doing a task like feeling overwhelmed and pressured. When you say you‚Äôll ‚Äúnever‚Äù do something again, you‚Äôre putting an inordinate amount of pressure on yourself and will be more likely to give up or procrastinate.  Instead, set in place a replacement action for the thing you want to ‚Äúnever‚Äù do again.  For example, ‚ÄúI will never be late add a 15-minute buffer in between my meeting slots each day so I won‚Äôt be late for the Monday morning stand up meeting again.‚Äù\n\n1. Spending more time on meaningful work\n\nSMART goal: ‚ÄúEvery day this week, I will work on our new marketing site redesign from 8:30 ‚Äì 10:30 am without interruption.‚Äù  Why this works: Not only does this goal set a clear timeline and expectations, it does so in a positive way that is realistic and easy to stay motivated towards. Each day, you know what you‚Äôre doing, when you‚Äôre going to do it, and why it matters.\n\nSMART goal: ‚ÄúI will schedule 2 hours on Thursday afternoon to personally email 10 people I‚Äôm already connected with on LinkedIn and ask them if they have 15 minutes to talk about their career path and how I should move forward.‚Äù  Why this works: This SMART goal answers all of the key questions‚Äîwhat you‚Äôre going to do, when, the process you‚Äôre going to use, and what you expect out of it. Additionally, it does so in a positive and motivating way, turning a big, audacious goal into something manageable.\n\nSMART goal: ‚ÄúEvery Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30‚Äì8:30 pm, I will work towards the Responsive Web Design certificate course on freeCodeCamp.‚Äù  Why this works: This SMART goal leaves nothing unclear. You know the skill you want to learn, how you‚Äôre going to learn it, and when and where that will happen.\n\nSMART goal: ‚ÄúI will set a RescueTime Alert to notify me when I‚Äôve spent more than 20 minutes on work tasks outside of the workday to help build a habit of leaving work at work.‚Äù  Why this works: Clarity is key. This SMART goal includes the specific process you‚Äôre going to take as well as the reasoning behind why you picked this goal in the first place.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Travel/":{"title":"Travel","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Travel/Travel":{"title":"","content":"### Notes\n```dataview\ntable file.ctime as Date from \"3.

I'm asked that question often, and it seems that every writers' symposium has a class with that title. It's an important technical issue, and not just for so-called suspense novels. Every novel needs a narrative engine, a reason for people to keep reading to the end, whatever the subject, style, genre or approach. But it's a bad question. Its very form misleads writers and pushes them onto an unhelpful and overcomplicated track.\n\nBecause \"How do you create suspense?\" has the same interrogatory shape as \"How do you bake a cake?\" And we all know --- in theory or practice --- how to bake a cake. We need ingredients, and we infer that the better quality those ingredients are, the better quality the cake will be. We know that we have to mix and stir those ingredients, and we're led to believe that the more thoroughly and conscientiously we combine them, the better the cake will taste. We know we have to cook the cake in an oven, and we figure that the more exact the temperature and timing, the better the cake will look.\n\nSo writers are taught to focus on ingredients and their combination. They're told they should create attractive, sympathetic characters, so that readers will care about them deeply, and then to plunge those characters into situations of continuing peril, the descent into which is the mixing and stirring, and the duration and horrors of which are the timing and temperature.\n\nBut it's really much simpler than that. \"How do you bake a cake?\" has the wrong structure. It's too indirect. The right structure and the right question is: \"How do you make your family hungry?\"\n\nAnd the answer is: You make them wait four hours for dinner.\n\nAs novelists, we should ask or imply a question at the beginning of the story, and then we should delay the answer.

I was in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood, waiting to meet a friend for breakfast. I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and was sitting on the bench outside, scrolling through my contact list. A girl, maybe 15 years old, was sitting on the bench opposite me, crying into her phone. I heard her say, \"I know, I know, I know\" over and over.\n\nWhat did she know? Had she done something wrong? Was she being comforted? And then she said, \"Mama, I know,\" and the tears came harder.\n\nWhat was her mother telling her? Never to stay out all night again? That everybody fails? Is it possible that no one was on the other end of the call, and that the girl was merely rehearsing a difficult conversation?\n\n\"Mama, I know,\" she said, and hung up, placing her phone on her lap.\n\nI was faced with a choice: I could interject myself into her life, or I could respect the boundaries between us. Intervening might make her feel worse, or be inappropriate. But then, it might ease her pain, or be helpful in some straightforward logistical way. An affluent neighborhood at the beginning of the day is not the same as a dangerous one as night is falling. And I was me, and not someone else. There was a lot of human computing to be done.\n\nIt is harder to intervene than not to, but it is vastly harder to choose to do either than to retreat into the scrolling names of one's contact list, or whatever one's favorite distraction happens to be.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/3.-Resouces/Writing/Sample-Writing":{"title":"Sample Writing","content":"\nHello world.\n\nJust a test.\n\nLorem ipsum.

The templates location will always be starting at\nthe /layout/ directory within Hugo.\n\n**Example:**\n\n    {{ template \"chrome/header.html\" . }}\n\n\n## Logic\n\nGo templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\n\n### Iteration\n\nJust like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over\na map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use\nrange.\n\n**Example 1: Using Context**\n\n```go\n{{ range array }}\n    {{ . }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n**Example 2: Declaring value variable name**\n\n```go\n{{range $element := array}}\n    {{ $element }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n**Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name**\n\n```go\n{{range $index, $element := array}}\n    {{ $index }}\n    {{ $element }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n### Conditionals\n\nIf, else, with, or, \u0026 and provide the framework for handling conditional\nlogic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with `end`.\n\n\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n\n* false\n* 0\n* any array, slice, map, or string of length zero\n\n**Example 1: If**\n\n```go\n{{ if isset .Params \"title\" }}\u003ch4\u003e{{ index .Params \"title\" }}\u003c/h4\u003e{{ end }}\n```\n\n**Example 2: If -\u003e Else**\n\n```go\n{{ if isset .Params \"alt\" }}\n    {{ index .Params \"alt\" }}\n{{else}}\n    {{ index .Params \"caption\" }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n**Example 3: And \u0026 Or**\n\n```go\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \"title\") (isset .Params \"caption\")) (isset .Params \"attr\")}}\n```\n\n**Example 4: With**\n\nAn alternative way of writing \"if\" and then referencing the same value\nis to use \"with\" instead. With rebinds the context `.` within its scope,\nand skips the block if the variable is absent.\n\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n\n```go\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u003ch4\u003e{{ . }}\u003c/h4\u003e{{ end }}\n```\n\n**Example 5: If -\u003e Else If**\n\n```go\n{{ if isset .Params \"alt\" }}\n    {{ index .Params \"alt\" }}\n{{ else if isset .Params \"caption\" }}\n    {{ index .Params \"caption\" }}\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n## Pipes\n\nOne of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to\nstack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed\nfrom unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline's output becomes the\ninput of the following pipe.\n\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential\nto being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the\npipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value\nbecomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\n\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\n\n**Example 1 :**\n\n    {{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}\n\nis the same as\n\n    {{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}\n\nIt does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good\nillustration of how to use the pipes.\n\n**Example 2 :**\n\n    {{ index .Params \"disqus_url\" | html }}\n\nAccess the page parameter called \"disqus_url\" and escape the HTML.\n\n**Example 3 :**\n\n    {{ if or (or (isset .Params \"title\") (isset .Params \"caption\")) (isset .Params \"attr\")}}\n    Stuff Here\n    {{ end }}\n\nCould be rewritten as\n\n    {{  isset .Params \"caption\" | or isset .Params \"title\" | or isset .Params \"attr\" | if }}\n    Stuff Here\n    {{ end }}\n\n\n## Context (aka. the dot)\n\nThe most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }}\nalways refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this\nwill be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have\nthe value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. .\nwill no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to\naccess this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable\ninstead of depending on the context.\n\n**Example:**\n\n      {{ $title := .Site.Title }}\n      {{ range .Params.tags }}\n        \u003cli\u003e \u003ca href=\"{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\"\u003e{{ . }}\u003c/a\u003e - {{ $title }} \u003c/li\u003e\n      {{ end }}\n\nNotice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We\nhave defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within\nthe loop.\n\n# Hugo Parameters\n\nHugo provides the option of passing values to the template language\nthrough the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta\ndata of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any\ntype (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however\nyou want to inside of your templates.\n\n\n## Using Content (page) Parameters\n\nIn each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the\ntemplates. This happens in the [front matter](/content/front-matter).\n\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages\nbenefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just\ndoesn't make a lot of sense. We've defined a variable in our front matter\nof some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\n\nHere is the example front matter:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Permalinks\"\ndate: \"2013-11-18\"\naliases:\n  - \"/doc/permalinks/\"\ngroups: [\"extras\"]\ngroups_weight: 30\nnotoc: true\n---\n```\n\nHere is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n\n      {{ if not .Params.notoc }}\n        \u003cdiv id=\"toc\" class=\"well col-md-4 col-sm-6\"\u003e\n        {{ .TableOfContents }}\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      {{ end }}\n\n\n\n## Using Site (config) Parameters\nIn your top-level configuration file (eg, `config.yaml`) you can define site\nparameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\n\nFor instance, you might declare:\n\n```yaml\nparams:\n  CopyrightHTML: \"Copyright \u0026#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\"\n  TwitterUser: \"spf13\"\n  SidebarRecentLimit: 5\n```\n\nWithin a footer layout, you might then declare a `\u003cfooter\u003e` which is only\nprovided if the `CopyrightHTML` parameter is provided, and if it is given,\nyou would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped\nagain.  This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each\nJanuary 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n\n```\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u003cfooter\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/footer\u003e{{end}}\n```\n\nAn alternative way of writing the \"if\" and then referencing the same value\nis to use \"with\" instead. With rebinds the context `.` within its scope,\nand skips the block if the variable is absent:\n\n```\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u003cspan class=\"twitter\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/{{.}}\" rel=\"author\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/twitter.png\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" title=\"Twitter: {{.}}\"\n alt=\"Twitter\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e{{end}}\n```\n\nFinally, if you want to pull \"magic constants\" out of your layouts, you can do\nso, such as in this example:\n\n```\n\u003cnav class=\"recent\"\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003eRecent Posts\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cul\u003e{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}}\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"{{.RelPermalink}}\"\u003e{{.Title}}\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  {{end}}\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/nav\u003e\n```\n\n\n[go]: https://golang.org/\n[gohtmltemplate]: https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/setup/":{"title":"Quartz Notes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.06849706Z","tags":null},"/setup/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\nÂá†‰πéÂú®Êàë‰ª¨ÊÑèËØÜÂà∞‰πãÂâçÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂú∞Èù¢„ÄÇ\n\nÏö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Í∑∏Í≤ÉÏùÑ ÏïåÍ∏∞ÎèÑ Ï†ÑÏóê Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî ÎïÖÏùÑ Îñ†ÎÇ¨ÏäµÎãàÎã§.\n\nÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„Åå„Åù„Çå„ÇíÁü•„Çã„Åª„ÅºÂâç„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„ÅØÂú∞Èù¢„ÇíÈõ¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T16:55:25.072497018Z","tags":null},"/setup/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
