# Welcome!
This is a small demo/sandbox of how the P.A.R.A system works to see for yourself and decide if it's interesting.

Tiago Forte developed the system for his use in Building a Second Brain. It's a folder based hierarchical structure for keeping track of your note based on actionability (more on that in Methodology)

## What to expect
I added some of my notes in some of the hierarchy folders to make it a bit more accurate. However, they are not all similarly formatted as they are from various app migration and workflow changes.

The folders are also more generic, as are the notes to keep them clean and usable. Since this system is very personal, your category will vary, but some (like Health, Finance, etc.) will most likely be the same.
Feels free to play around with it and explore or copy it for yourself

*Feels free to play around with it, explore and copy it for yourself. For the best experience make sure to enable "Dataview" and  "Folder Notes" in the community plugin section. They're not enabled by default for compatibility and security reason, but they are a part of this setup.*
