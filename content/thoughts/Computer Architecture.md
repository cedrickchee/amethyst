title: "Computer Architecture"
---

Computer Architecture — sometimes called "computer systems" or "computer
organization" — is an important first look at computing below the surface of
software. In my experience, it's the most neglected area among self-taught
software engineers.

My favorite introductory book is _[[thoughts/CS:APP | Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)]]_, and an [introductory computer systems course](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html) using the book.

I love CS:APP for the practical, programmer-oriented approach.

For those who'd prefer both a gentler introduction to the topic and a balance of
hardware and software concerns, I suggest _[[The Elements of Computing Systems]]_, also known as [["Nand2Tetris"]]. This is an ambitious book
attempting to give you a cohesive understanding of how everything in a computer
works. Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from
writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way
to an application the size of a Tetris game.
