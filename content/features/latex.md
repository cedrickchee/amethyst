Block math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    f\hat(\xi),e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi$$
	
Inline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`. For example, Euler's identity but inline: $e^{i\pi} = -1$

Aligned equations work quite well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= b + c \\ &= e + f \\
\end{aligned}
$$

And matrices

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
a & b & c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
