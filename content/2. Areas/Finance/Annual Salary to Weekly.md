## Notes:

### Calculate approximate
- To get an approximate number divide new annual total with 1.50
- Divide the total by 26 to get weekly numbers
ex. 61500 / 1.50 = 4100 / 26 = 1576

### Calculate new percent
- Take the current weekly total * 26
- This will give the current annual after taxes, insurance, etc
- Now just divide the current full annual with this
