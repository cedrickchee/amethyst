I use [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) as my system of
note-taking and personal knowledge management for research, study, and writing.

The slip box[^1] is a place where I'm building up a Zettelkasten of index cards
for my research. These are digital index cards.

A slip box consists of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards
that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such
as numbers and tags.
